Welcome to DevsAppLab!

This is going to be my new blog where I post all of my ideas, things I have learned when working on projects, and my journey as a developer.

I also want to talk about new technologies and the applications they will be used in.

In the meantime, I will still be posting on the blog that is attached to my portfolio site which is www.devcarr.com/Blog.
